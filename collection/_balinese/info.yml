  Breed: Balinese
  Description: The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese, since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed[1], and hence is essentially the same cat with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_cat
